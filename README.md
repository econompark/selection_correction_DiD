## Overview

The selection correction method is designed for settings where the (conditional) parallel trends assumption is violated due to **unobserved factors**.  
It builds on standard assumptions from the sample selection and endogenous switching regression literature.

This repository includes:
- Example data
- Sample code for implementation
