## Overview

The **selection correction method** is designed for settings where the (conditional) parallel trends assumption is violated due to **unobserved factors**.  
It builds on standard assumptions from the **sample selection** and **endogenous switching regression** literature.

This repository includes:
- Example datasets  
- Sample code for implementation
